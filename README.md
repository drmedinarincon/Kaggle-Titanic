# Kaggle-Titanic

This repo is a submission to the Kaggle competition "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster".

The contents of the repo are:
- train.csv : Info on 891 passengers along with their survival status after the disaster.
- test.csv : Info on 418 passengers without survival status after the disaster.
- Classifier.ipynb : This file does some data cleaning and feature engineering. Then uses several machine learning models trained on data from train.csv 
to later classify the passengers in test.csv into survivors and deceased.
